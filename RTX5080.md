# manually install the latest NVIDIA driver
```
sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver-570-open
```

# ensure that Secure Boot is disabled (as it can block proprietary kernel modules),
```
Secure Boot     disabled
Secure Boot Mode     standard
```
# verify that any conflicting drivers (like nouveau) are properly blacklisted
```
grep -i 'blacklist nouveau' /etc/modprobe.d/*
lsmod | grep nouveau
```

Run a search in your modprobe configuration files:
```
grep -i 'blacklist nouveau' /etc/modprobe.d/*
### This command should return lines indicating entries such as “blacklist nouveau” if they exist.

Check if the nouveau module is active:
lsmod | grep nouveau
If nothing is returned, then the module is not loaded. However, your output clearly shows that nouveau is active with multiple entries.

in the absence of blacklist entries (as shown by the grep command) combined with the fact that the nouveau module is loaded (as shown by lsmod) means that nouveau has not been properly blacklisted.

To resolve this, you'll need to create or modify a configuration file—commonly named /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf—and add the following lines:

blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
After saving the file, update the initramfs so the changes take effect:

sudo update-initramfs -u
Then, reboot your system. After rebooting, run:

lsmod | grep nouveau
Again to verify that the nouveau driver is no longer loaded.
```

confirm it is RTX5080
